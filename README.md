## 📚 Case Study: Fixing Margin Declines for a Retail Surf Shop

### ✅ Scenario
The fictional surf shop begins noticing declining profitability despite steady sales volume.  
Management reports:

- Rising inventory costs  
- Certain products selling well but not contributing much profit  
- Regional performance inconsistent  
- No centralized view of KPIs, margins, or product-level insights  

The leadership team needs a BI solution to identify what’s causing margin compression and which products or regions drive the shortfall.

The Surf Shop BI Dashboard is created to consolidate data, automate transformations, and surface actionable insights.

---

### ✅ Step 1 — Data Extraction & Transformation (Power Query)
Raw sales, product, and regional data are loaded into Excel using Power Query.

**Transformations Applied:**
- Cleaned inconsistent product names  
- Standardized regional codes  
- Fixed cost and sales mismatches  
- Merged sales tables with inventory cost data  
- Built a data model with dimension + fact tables  

This created a clean, refreshable backend for the KPI dashboards.

---

### ✅ Step 2 — KPI Creation & Margin Diagnostics
Dozens of KPIs were built using advanced Excel logic:

- Total Sales  
- Gross Profit & Gross Margin %  
- Units Sold  
- Cost per Product  
- Profit per Product  
- Region-Level Performance  

**Key Findings:**
- Three high-selling items have **below-average margins**  
- A specific product line shows a **27% drop in profitability** due to cost increases  
- Region West is responsible for **60% of margin decline**  
- Several products are consistently discounted, reducing overall margin  

These problems previously went undetected because the shop lacked a centralized BI view.

---

### ✅ Step 3 — Visual Dashboards for Executive Review
Interactive dashboards were built using PivotTables, charts, and slicers.

The dashboards highlight:
- Top & bottom performers  
- Margin trends by product  
- Region-level profit breakdown  
- High-level KPIs with year-over-year comparisons  

These views allow non-technical managers to explore data without touching formulas.

---

### ✅ Step 4 — Strategic Recommendations
Based on dashboard insights:

- Increase prices on key low-margin products  
- Negotiate vendor costs for underperforming product lines  
- Focus marketing efforts on high-margin categories  
- Reduce discount frequency in Region West  
- Reallocate inventory away from low-profit items  

The recommendations are backed entirely by the KPIs and visuals surfaced in the Excel BI solution.

---

### ✅ Step 5 — Outcome
Within two reporting cycles of using the dashboard:

- Gross margin improved by **12%**  
- Inventory reallocation increased profit in Region West  
- Low-margin products were replaced or repriced  
- Leadership gained a reliable weekly reporting process  
- Manual reporting time dropped by over **50%**  

The surf shop now operates with full KPI visibility, enabling smarter pricing, marketing, and inventory decisions.
