# 📚 Case Study: Fixing Margin Declines for a Retail Surf Shop

### ✅ Scenario
A fictional surf shop experiences a steady decline in overall profitability despite stable sales volume.  
Store leadership raises concerns:

- Popular items are not generating expected profit  
- Region-level performance varies without explanation  
- Inventory costs rising faster than revenue  
- No centralized reporting system to diagnose the issue  

The surf shop adopts this Excel BI system to understand performance issues and restore margins.

---

### ✅ Step 1 — Data Extraction & Cleanup (Power Query)
Power Query ingests raw sales, product, and region files.

**Transformations completed:**
- Standardized product names  
- Cleaned inconsistent region codes  
- Removed duplicates  
- Merged cost + sales tables  
- Built a structured data model for dashboards  

This ensures all dashboards refresh with clean, validated data.

### ✅ Step 2 — KPI Modeling & Margin Diagnostics
Using Excel formulas and calculated fields, KPIs are created:

- Total Revenue  
- Total Profit  
- Margin %  
- Profit by Product  
- Profit by Region  
- Units Sold  
- Discount Impact Analysis  

**Key Findings:**
- Three high-volume products operate at **below-average margins**  
- Region West accounts for **60%** of the total margin decline  
- A major product category suffered a **27%** cost increase  
- Discount habits in specific regions eroded overall margins  

These insights were previously hidden due to siloed spreadsheets.

---

### ✅ Step 3 — Visual Dashboards for Management
Interactive dashboards present:

- Product-level profit breakdown  
- Region-level margin comparison  
- KPIs for revenue, units, and profitability  
- Trends showing cost behavior vs. revenue growth  

Leadership can quickly isolate what’s driving profit loss instead of relying on static month-end summaries.

---

### ✅ Step 4 — Strategic Recommendations
Based on the analysis:

- Increase pricing on low-margin items  
- Renegotiate supplier terms for high-cost categories  
- Limit discounting in poor-margin regions  
- Shift inventory toward high-ROI products  
- Target marketing toward profitable categories  

---

### ✅ Step 5 — Outcome
Within two reporting cycles:

- Gross margin increased by **12%**  
- Region West profitability stabilized  
- Low-margin products were repriced or discontinued  
- Reporting time dropped by **50%+**  
- Leadership now uses the dashboard as a weekly operations tool  

This BI workflow gives the surf shop full visibility into what drives profit—and what erodes it.
